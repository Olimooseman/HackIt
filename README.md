# HackIt
A Python game

This is in no way realistic - just practicing my python text-game making skills :)

Run 'hackit.py' with python3 (but beware... you have to pip3 install colorama...)
Enjoy! :) Only the tutorial and starter missions are stored right now.

If you're struggling with what to do when it first loads, type 'help'.
